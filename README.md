The idea behind this application is around 3 Users Admin, Clinicians and Managers. Where all patients needs would be handled through tasks which managers could create for ther own departments with admins controlling overall systems. 
With use case diagram looking something like this.

An a database with hindsight was too complicate for the scope of my work.

Idea that tasks could to associated with other tasks from an appointment -> referral -> medical imaging

This then developed into to a **Task Forms**
Where you could create and preview a dynamic form where it could me allocated to a department. However I found this very hard to maintain and code into practice so it's not as polished as I would like.
